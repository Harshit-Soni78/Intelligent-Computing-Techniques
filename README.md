## Plan to cover the Syllabus

This is a well-structured syllabus covering core aspects of soft computing, including AI search techniques, knowledge representation, neural networks, and fuzzy logic. To conduct hands-on sessions covering both theoretical and practical aspects, we need to identify suitable exercises, coding implementations, and interactive demonstrations for each unit.

### **Analysis of the Syllabus & Hands-on Session Plan**

Hereâ€™s how we can approach each unit practically:

#### **Unit 1: Introduction to Soft Computing**

- **Theory:** Difference between soft and hard computing, types of soft computing.
- **Hands-on:**
  - Implement a Python script demonstrating a real-world example of soft computing (e.g., a basic AI-based decision-making system).
  - Compare a hard-coded rule-based system vs. a soft computing-based system.

#### **Unit 2: Artificial Intelligence Search Techniques**

- **Theory:** Introduction to AI production systems, search techniques like BFS, DFS, Hill Climbing, A\*, and AO\*.
- **Hands-on:**
  - Implement **BFS & DFS** for a graph using Python.
  - Solve an optimization problem using **Hill Climbing**.
  - Implement \__A_ Algorithm\_\* for pathfinding (using grid-based navigation).
  - Use **networkx** or visualization libraries to represent search trees.

#### **Unit 3: Knowledge Representation & Reasoning**

- **Theory:** Logic-based reasoning, propositional & predicate logic, monotonic vs. non-monotonic reasoning.
- **Hands-on:**
  - Implement propositional logic using Python.
  - Use **Prolog** (or Python libraries like `sympy.logic`) to implement predicate logic-based AI reasoning.
  - Develop a **rule-based chatbot** using basic NLP techniques.

#### **Unit 4: Neural Networks**

- **Theory:** Artificial neurons, perceptron learning, applications of neural networks.
- **Hands-on:**
  - Implement a **single-layer perceptron** from scratch using NumPy.
  - Train a perceptron to classify **linearly separable data**.
  - Introduce **multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)** and use TensorFlow/PyTorch for classification tasks (e.g., MNIST digits).

#### **Unit 5: Fuzzy Logic & Decision Making**

- **Theory:** Fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, decision-making.
- **Hands-on:**
  - Implement a **Fuzzy Logic System** using the `skfuzzy` library in Python.
  - Build a fuzzy decision-making model (e.g., an AI-based weather prediction system using fuzzy rules).
  - Compare crisp vs. fuzzy classification.
