Please analyse this syllabus, I want to conduct few hands-on sessions to cover practical and theoritical aspacts of this syllabus.

First analyse this syllabus and let me know if you are ready to give me some contant for each unit so that I can conduct few hands-on sessions to cover practical and theoritical aspacts of this syllabus.
